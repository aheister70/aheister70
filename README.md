Hi 👋🏻 I am Anna,

I study at Codam Coding College Amsterdam since October 2020 after/during a career in UX design. I use Github to store the code of my study projects.
A few examples are:

• <b>miniRT</b> - a minimal raytracing engine (written in C) supporting spheres, planes, cylinders and triangles.<br>
• <b>push-swap</b> - a project involving sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves (written in C).<br>
• <b>minishell</b> - a program that behaves like a simple shell like bash or zsh (written in C).
