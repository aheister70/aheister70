Hi 👋🏻,

I am Anna and I study at Codam Coding College Amsterdam since October 2020 after/during a career in UX/UI design. I use Github to store the code of my study projects. A few examples are:

• <b>webserv</b> - this project is about writing your own HTTP server<br>
• <b>miniRT</b> - a minimal raytracing engine supporting spheres, planes, cylinders and triangles.<br>
• <b>push-swap</b> - a project involving sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves.<br>
• <b>minishell</b> - a program that behaves like a simple shell like bash or zsh.
