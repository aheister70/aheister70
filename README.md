Hi 👋🏻 I am Anna,

I study at Codam Coding College Amsterdam since October 2020. I use Github to store the code of my study projects.
Most of these projects are written in C/C++. 

A few examples are:

• miniRT - a minimal raytracing engine (written in C) supporting spheres, planes, cylinders and triangles

• push-swap - a project involving sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves (written in C)

• minishell - a program that behaves like a simple shell like bash or zsh (written in C)
